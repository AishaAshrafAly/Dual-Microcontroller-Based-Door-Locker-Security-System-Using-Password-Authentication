# Dual-Microcontroller-Based-Door-Locker-Security-System-Using-Password-Authentication
This project implements a smart door security system using two microcontrollers (HMI_ECU and Control_ECU), with UART communication between them. The system utilizes password authentication, motorized door control, and several additional features like a PIR sensor, EEPROM for password storage, and a buzzer for alerts.
